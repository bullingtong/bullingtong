## Ethics ##
#Graeson Bullington, bullingtong#
> Three ethical considerations I have about software engineering is mainly with the security of using open-sourced software engineering software. One is how do you know that the open-sourced project doesn't contain any code that tracks whatsoftware you're attempting to produce. Another one is what if you're asked to create a project that could cause harm to others reputation. Lastly, my final concern is even though there is a code of ethics, if someone doesn't follow them are are they going to get in trouble for not abiding by them?
